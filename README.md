XML Optics library for Scala

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/note/xml-lens.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/note/xml-lens)

## Motivation

XML scala libraries are kind of neglected. That stands in stark contrast to JSON for which Scala has dozens of projects.
Of course, JSON is much more popular and XML at the same time is regarded as a legacy standard but still - there are many situations where you need to work with XML.

## Status of project

Library is in an early state of initial development.
